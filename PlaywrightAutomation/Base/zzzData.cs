        public static string newsArticle0 = "The Filthy Truth About Your Tap Water\r\nThe US is proposing bold action to clean thousands of “forever chemicals” out of drinking water. It’s long overdue.\r\nFOLLOWING YEARS OF concern, the US Environmental Protection Agency moved this week to clean up drinking water, announcing the nation’s first standards for six “forever chemicals” found in tap water. It’s a foreboding and informal name for human-made chemicals that coat nonstick pans, food packaging, and waterproof clothes before ending up in the water you drink. These chemicals, known as PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are pervasive and found in pretty much everyone—even newborn babies.\r\nIf the EPA rule is finalized, public water companies will need to monitor for the chemicals and keep two widely studied ones, PFOA and PFOS, below levels of 4 parts per trillion—around the lowest threshold measurable. The rule will also regulate combined amounts of four other types of PFAS chemicals. \r\n \r\nExperts say the proposal is monumental. It marks not just the first US national standard for regulating levels of these chemicals, but would also allow for widespread data collection to see which communities are most affected by contamination. Implementing these much needed fixes could take years and will be costly. Still, experts see this as a significant first step in pushing back against the PFAS problem, and one that could vastly improve water quality across the nation. \r\n“These are very strong, health protective, and a historic move to really limit exposure to contamination from these chemicals,” says David Andrews, a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit focused on health and environmental advocacy. “There are lots of opportunities to build off of this.” \r\nThe PFAS regulation is not yet a reality; it's a proposed measure that could be finalized this year after a public comment period. If it is formally adopted, it will result in new expenses for many public water systems, requiring not only testing but filtering water when contaminants are detected. The utilities would have three years to comply with the rule, so some communities might not see results until 2026. \r\nThe dangers of PFAS chemicals have become increasingly clear. High levels of exposure can cause fertility issues, developmental delays in children, and reduced immune responses, according to the EPA. They can also elevate the risk of several cancers, including prostate, kidney, and testicular cancer. \r\nThe US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a report in 2022 saying health care providers should counsel and test patients who are more likely to have elevated PFAS exposure based on where they live or work. And EPA officials estimate that cleaning up the water will prevent thousands of deaths—and tens of thousands of cases of serious illness—in the US. \r\nRegulating the two commonly studied chemicals, as well as four additional ones, is “a really important first step,” says Katie Pelch, a scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a nonprofit environmental advocacy group. But there is more to learn about this vast group of chemicals and their prevalence. “This is still just a proposal to regulate six PFAS out of a class of thousands of chemicals,” she continues. The processes to remove PFAS could also tackle other chemicals found in drinking water, such as those from pharmaceuticals, flame retardants, and consumer products.\r\nStill, EPA-mandated testing would provide a valuable close-up look at how prevalent these chemicals are. In the US, PFAS contaminants have been detected in more than 2,800 locations in all 50 states and two territories, according to data from the Environmental Working Group. A 2020 study found that as many as 200 million Americans may be exposed to PFAS in drinking water. \r\nBut there are areas that have not done testing, obfuscating the full extent of the problem, says Laurel Schaider, a senior scientist at the Silent Spring Institute, a nonprofit that researches links between chemicals and women’s health. “That alone is going to be a game changer,” Schaider says.\r\nPFAS are more prevalent in communities near manufacturing plants, airports, and wastewater treatment centers—all of which tend to be lower-income areas. If mandated testing begins, it could uncover vast disparities in PFAS concentrations. \r\nThe EPA proposal is far more aggressive than a patchwork of existing regulations in US states like Massachusetts and Michigan, and experts say it may be the strongest to date around the world. It comes on the heels of action by the European Union, which updated its Drinking Water Directive in 2021 and set a combined PFAS limit of 500 nanograms per liter (equivalent to 500 parts per trillion) for drinking water. Canada recently proposed a new standard that would set the combined limit at 30 nanograms per liter (30 parts per trillion).\r\nThe World Health Organization has also released a new recommendation for limits of 100 parts per trillion for PFOA and PFOS in drinking water. The EPA’s proposed caps for those chemicals are much stricter, at just 4 parts per trillion. More than 100 scientists signed a letter criticizing the health agency for what they saw as a recommendation that ignored research and set limits too high. The discrepancy between WHO and EPA standards could lead some countries to set limits far above what scientists consider safe. \r\nOther water quality issues have persisted despite existing regulation. In the US, the Safe Drinking Water Act, passed in 1974 and since amended, regulates more than 90 contaminants found in tap water. But a 2017 report by the NRDC found that 80,000 violations of the act had been reported in 2015, affecting an estimated 77 million people and spanning 18,000 water systems. \r\nRegulators should also “think upstream,” when it comes to protecting people against forever chemicals, says Schaider. That means stopping their production and reducing their presence in the water system—not just filtering them out. The European Union is evaluating a proposal to ban the production and use of 10,000 PFAS chemicals. That’s the kind of action the US needs to take next, experts say. “Setting a drinking water standard is at the last step,” says Schaider, “after the contamination has happened.” \r\n\r\n\r\nAmanda Hoover is a general assignment staff writer at WIRED.

        public static string newsArticle1 = "The Ugly Lessons of Silicon Valley Bank’s Collapse\r\nNotoriously smart risk-takers missed a huge threat under their own noses, while avowed libertarians begged for government help.\r\n\r\nAT FIRST GLANCE, the Silicon Valley Bank debacle seems to be a cut-and-dried financial caper. The executives running the 16th-largest bank in the US made the wrong choices in handling what seemed a fortuitous situation—a roster of clients, flush with venture capital funding, handing over billions of dollars of cash for storage in the institution's coffers. But the bank’s leaders misjudged the risks of higher interest rates and inflation. Pair that with a mini tech downturn, and the bank’s spreadsheets began turning colors. When word of its perilous situation got out, panicky depositors pulled their money. After a government takeover, everyone’s money was safe. \r\nThis is an edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter.\r\nBut although no depositor lost money, the saga looks like a traumatic event whose consequences will linger for months, or even years. Things happened that we can’t unsee. The SVB saga reminds me of what my wife, a true-crime reporter, says when people ask why she finds murder stories so interesting. A killing, she’d say, reveals the previously private, shrouded actions that define the way people live. In the course of investigating the crime, lives that looked ideal from the outside are exposed as unmade beds of secrets and lies. \r\nStart with the bank. As has been widely reported—only now with a critical eye—Silicon Valley Bank was not only the bank of choice among Silicon Valley companies, but an ingratiating cheerleader for startup culture. The VCs and angels funding new companies would routinely send entrepreneurs to the bank, which often handled both company accounts and the personal finances of founders and executives. SVB would party with tech people—and vintners, another sector they were deep into. Some bankers had wine fridges in their offices. Salud!\r\nNormally, you’d have to hold my family hostage before I became a banker—I picture the buttoned-up prig who hired Mary Poppins. But I might think differently if banking were a world of parties, high-end Cabernets, and elbow-rubbing with universe-denting geniuses who keep millions in the bank and take out mega-mortgages. By all accounts, SBV shared and perhaps amplified the freewheeling vibe of the swashbucklers it served. This is not what you necessarily want from a fiduciary. And as we learned this week, SVB’s CEO reportedly indulged in one of the worst things a founder can do—selling off stock when trouble lies ahead. \r\n When that trouble arrived, we also learned a lot about the investment lords of the Valley who give founders the millions they need to move fast and make things. As word began to leak of SVB’s weaknesses, VCs who style themselves as tech’s smartest people had a choice: help bolster the financial partner holding the industry’s assets or pull funds immediately. The latter course would trigger a panic that would assure disaster for the startup ecosystem—but not you, because you were first in line. \r\nDespite years of talk about how companies in the tech world are united in a beneficial joint mission, some of the biggest players went into self-preservation mode, essentially firing the starting pistol for a bank run. One notable bailout leader was Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, which got an early sense of SVB’s troubles and advised all its companies to get out ASAP. As word spread, a classic bank run took shape, with other VC firms urging pullouts, until it was impossible to connect online with SVB to move funds. By the time a group of VCs came together to pledge support for SVB, its virtual doors were shut. In the mad rush to the lifeboats, hundreds of companies were stranded on deck. When the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took over Silicon Valley Bank last Friday, with all activity frozen, those whose holdings in the bank far exceeded the $250,000 limit on insured accounts truly faced the abyss.\r\nAnd what did the Valley’s rugged individuals do when oblivion loomed? They begged for a government rescue, of course. It’s hard not to empathize with some of the rank and file tech workers, many of them far from California, who wouldn’t be able to meet their bills. And indeed, there were some acts of generosity, as investors extended loans to their portfolio companies. But the loudest voices urging bailouts didn’t seem to be those most in jeopardy, but super-rich investors and speculators likeself-described angel investor Jason Calacanis, PayPal mafia billionaire David Sacks, and Machiavellian hedge fund magnate Bill Ackman, bombing Twitter with over-the-top pleas to rescue depositors.\r\nTheir case was that if depositors didn’t have immediate access to their funds, SVB’s woes might be “contagious,” setting off a wider bank panic. A reasonable concern. But it’s unlikely these pundits would have made the same arguments if the institution in question were some regional bank of similar size in the Midwest. Some people arguing for a federal bailout had previously opined that the government should keep its tentacles away from the innovative geniuses of the Valley.\r\nThe spectacle is particularly ironic because a huge part of startup lore is not just accepting risk but embracing it. We hear endlessly of the bravery of entrepreneurs who step into the breach and put millions of dollars in jeopardy, hoping to buck the dismal odds of creating a difference-making company that, by the way, makes its founders ludicrously wealthy. It’s part of the game to lose your investor’s money and a couple of years of your life because you felt that a $400 juice machine would be the next iPhone. \r\nNow those noble risk-takers were demanding retroactive protection—because tech-company money was unavailable due to a totally avoidable risk. Any idiot knows that FDIC covers only $250,000. So why did so many firms store all their assets in uninsured accounts in a single bank? You might give a pass to naive founders who blindly accepted the recommendation of their funders to use Silicon Valley Bank. (Though maybe not to big companies like Roku, which had $487 million on deposit in SVB.) But what’s the excuse of those who did the recommending? Did they notice that SBV executives actively lobbied to avoid stringent regulation? Or that for eight months, SVB failed to replace its retired chief risk officer? Did they understand that an entire startup monoculture patronizing one bank made a huge industry dependent on a single point of failure?\r\nMeanwhile, less verbose investors and VCs quietly worked behind the scenes on convincing the FDIC to guarantee all deposits. One of the Valley’s top seed investors, Ron Conway, reportedly even got Vice President Kamala Harris on the phone to hear his plea for a depositor bailout. The case they made for protecting funds from a maximum $250,000 to, well, infinity, was a more refined version of what the Twitter panics-spreaders were saying: It would stem a collapse in the tech sector and calm people all over the country who were suddenly worried about their own banks’ stability. (It would also mean that from this point forward, holding to the limit is indefensible.) It’s not clear whether the lobbying affected the actual decision. But the attempts were unseemly, an unattractive display of the power of this massive industry. \r\nSo what has been uncovered in the week since we learned that Silicon Valley Bank was no more trustworthy than a crypto spam text? A startup culture once considered the gem of the economy has been exposed as careless with its money, clueless in its judgment of character, hypocritical in its ideology, and ruthless in exercising its political clout as a powerful special interest. Meanwhile, the financial world is still jittery, with other banks failing and just about everyone wondering what comes next. And from here on, the concept of a cap on FDIC insurance is at risk. But at least the SBV credit cards are working again. And VCs can take a victory lap as they brag about how they saved the day.\r\n\r\nTime Travel\r\nThings were so much simpler in 2007. I wrote about the then nascent Y Combinator startup incubator, and even sat in when investor Mike Maples first met with the founders of Weebly, a DIY website company. Since I wrote the story, Y Combinator has invested in over 4,000 startups, with a combined valuation of over $600 billion. Its initial investment in each company has skyrocketed from under $20,000 to half a million bucks. And Maples, then early in his investment career, has become one of the Valley’s top seed funders. His super-early stake in Weebly, for instance, paid off well—in 2018, Square bought the company for $385 million. It’s not clear whether the Weeblies deposited their winnings into a Silicon Valley Bank account.\r\nY Combinator’s model dovetails perfectly with the new startup ethic in Silicon Valley. It’s dramatically cheaper to start a company now than it was in the dot-com boom, and possible to build a substantial operation before requiring venture capital or achieving that liquidity event. (To pay salaries and costs during that time, one can get “angel funding”—less money than a VC firm pays, but in exchange for less equity.) Software tools, which used to cost hundreds of thousands, are now largely free. A wide variety of tasks can be outsourced cheaply. Computers, servers, bandwidth, and storage cost a fraction of what they did a decade ago. And there’s no need for a marketing budget when you’ve got internet word of mouth.\r\nAs a result, when it comes to funding, “$500,000 is the new $5 million,” says tech investor Mike Maples. It’s several weeks into the program, and Maples is in a Palo Alto, California, coffeehouse for a meeting with the Weeblies. He sees a lot of people barely out of their teens. The old wisdom for investors in startups said you needed an experienced hand as a CEO. The Valley’s new wisdom: Don’t fund anyone over 30. The average age of Y Combinator founders is 25.\r\nWhen the Weeblies show up for the meeting, they pull up Maples’ website and, using their software, clone it almost instantly. Then they show him how he can use Weebly to tweak it easily and even redesign it. Maples’s eyes open wide. Later he will explain that at that moment, he was determined to help fund the Weebly team.\r\n\r\nAsk Me One Thing\r\nChris asks, “What lesson would you prioritize in teaching children about generative AI?”\r\nThanks for the question, Chris. This is a hard one, because generative AI—software that’s trained on huge amounts of information and can generate content instantly in response to text prompts—is in its first stages. The kids confronting it today will be using hugely more powerful versions when they reach adulthood. I suspect that by then they will be generative-AI-native, just like previous generations were the first to claim themselves as PC-native or social-media-native. Eventually those gen-AI kids will be teaching us how to handle it.\r\nFor now, I would encourage kids to play with the generative AI chatbots and other tools in use now, and those soon to be released. It’s a great way to satisfy curiosity about various subjects. But I would emphasize that not all the information chatbots provide is accurate, and some of it is crazy wrong. I would urge them to regard the responses as pointers to primary sources, online and off. Like … books. Of course, I’d tell them not to use AI outputs to replace homework. You might fool your teachers, but you won’t learn anything. \r\nBut most of all, I’d drill it into their heads that while a chatbot might come off like a person, it’s not human. It’s a tool, and even if it calls you by your name and responds in a friendly way, it’s not your friend. And then I’d take them to the library to find a good book.\r\n\r\n";
        public static string newsArticle2 = "Microsoft and Google Unveil A.I. Tools for Businesses\r\nNew artificial intelligence technology is roiling Silicon Valley. For now, the most obvious ways to use it are in software like Microsoft’s suite of products.\r\nBy Karen Weise and Nico Grant\r\nKaren Weise writes about Microsoft in Seattle, and Nico Grant writes about Google in San Francisco.\r\nMarch 16, 2023\r\nFor all the talk about the transformative nature of new technology called generative artificial intelligence, some of the earlier commercial uses may be far more prosaic: formatting a PowerPoint slide, summarizing a call or writing to-do lists.\r\nMany of the first broad applications of generative A.I. have burst into the realm of the consumer internet, with open-ended chats and more sophisticated versions of internet search. But announcements this week by Microsoft and Google about adding A.I. into the daily tools of knowledge workers and software developers show how the mundane — but very profitable — software for businesses may be the clearest moneymakers.\r\n“As we look ahead, we believe this next generation of A.I. will unlock a new wave of productivity growth,” Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, said while announcing a set of tools Thursday. He added that new features would “remove the drudgery from our daily tasks and jobs.”\r\nThe new tools are more sober than visions of how generative A.I. might evolve or upend Google’s search engine, used by billions of people, but they form a crucial part of Google’s and Microsoft’s strategies to cash in on their A.I. investments.\r\nMicrosoft has made a series of announcements describing how it plans to push A.I. into all corners of its business. It has committed $13 billion into its partnership with the start-up OpenAI, whose ChatGPT chatbot captured the public imagination when it was released at the end of November. Just over a month ago, Microsoft also integrated OpenAI’s models into its Bing search engine.\r\nThursday’s announcement cuts to the heart of some of Microsoft’s largest businesses, in products like its software suite that includes Word, Excel and Outlook. Office products and related cloud services produced $11.8 billion in revenue in Microsoft’s latest quarter, while search and news advertising generated about $3.2 billion in sales.\r\nMicrosoft focused on integrating A.I. assistants, which it calls Copilots, into software. It is drawing on data that business customers have already stored in the company’s systems — chats in its collaboration tool Teams, documents stored in its cloud and emails on its servers.\r\nWith Business Chat, a new feature for working across the tools, someone can ask for a customer update and it will scan recent emails, meeting notes and other information to generate a response.\r\nThe products are being tested by 20 business customers, and pricing and licensing details will be released in the coming weeks, Jared Spataro, a Microsoft executive, said in an interview.\r\nThe assistants produce sample text, but Microsoft stressed that users should review and tweak the results. When generating text, the Copilot may make mistakes or generate irrelevant information.\r\nIt can also suggest feelings or emotions. One executive showed how the Copilot in Word could write a personal speech celebrating her daughter’s high school graduation. “In summary, to say we are proud of Tasha would be an understatement,” the model proposed.\r\nAs Mr. Spataro demonstrated how he could use the assistant to generate an email providing his feedback on a draft of a blog post, the A.I. tool generated an email that said Mr. Spataro was “impressed” and had made minor grammatical changes to the post — though it had no way of knowing whether he was “impressed” or that the changes were only grammatical.\r\n“It doesn’t know at all,” Mr. Spataro said when asked about it. He said the email should be edited, adding, “I mean, this is an example of why we called it a Copilot.”\r\nLast month, Microsoft pulled back some of the new Bing’s functions after its chat produced inaccurate, bizarre and at times creepy results. The new Bing had “millions of active users” in its first month, about a third of whom had not used Bing before, the company said. The company has said it will experiment with how to integrate ads into the results.\r\nMicrosoft has been jockeying with Google, which has said its chatbot, Bard, will be released in the “coming weeks” as an experimental demonstration. But Dan Taylor, Google’s vice president of global ads, said in an interview last month that the company had not yet figured out a way to make money from the chatbot.\r\nIn an announcement on Tuesday, Google underscored a similar path to generate profit from A.I. technology: by incorporating it into software that businesses pay for, and selling the underlying A.I. to other organizations.\r\nGoogle said it would embed A.I. into its email and word-processing tools, Gmail and Docs, so that it could draft emails, job descriptions and other types of documents from simple written prompts. With a few clicks, Google said, users could then adjust the tone to be more playful or professional, and have the A.I. trim or expand on the content. The features will first be available to what the company called trusted users.\r\nThomas Kurian, the chief executive of Google Cloud, which sells software and services to other businesses, said in a blog post that generative A.I. was a generational shift in technology, akin to the move from desktop computing to mobile devices. Powered by a system known as a large language model, the A.I. can generate text and other media when given short prompts.\r\nJust as software developers flocked to develop applications for the iPhone, Google expects that many programmers will want to build new A.I. applications and businesses. Mr. Kurian said the company would offer two new products, PaLM API and MakerSuite, to aid their efforts.\r\nGoogle also debuted Generative AI App Builder, a tool to help businesses and governments quickly develop their own chatbots. The company will also let organizations customize A.I. with their own data through an existing product, Vertex AI.\r\nBuilding large language models is an expensive enterprise requiring rare and specialized engineers, and supercomputers built specifically to handle the processing demands. Most companies will not have the resources to replicate Google’s, Microsoft’s or OpenAI’s years of work building these systems, so the companies are racing to fulfill their demand.\r\nMr. Kurian said he expected this generation of A.I. to have “a profound effect on every industry.”\r\nCade Metz contributed reporting.\r\nKaren Weise is a technology correspondent based in Seattle, covering Amazon and Microsoft.
